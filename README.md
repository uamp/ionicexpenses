# Ionic Expenses App (basic)
by J Johnson

Basic expenses example, front end only.  Built in Angular 2 & Ionic.
Capacitor is already added and configured for both IOS & Android.
Equally, PWA libraries have been included to allow it to be viewed on a 
standard web viewer and access local camera functionality.

Ensure the ionic CLI is installed globally using:
```
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```
then run:

```
npm install
ionic serve
```
